# CRAWLING DATA PRACTIICE
I do these exercise with construction of this git repo:
https://github.com/danielbeach/data-engineering-practice

## SKILL:
* Python data processing.
* csv, flat-file, parquet, json, etc.

## LIST OF EXERCISE:

### Exercise 1 - Downloading files.
The [first exercise](data-engineering-practice/exercise-1) tests your ability to download a number of files from an HTTP source and unzip them,
storing them locally with Python. `cd exercise-1` and see README in that location for instructions.

### Exercise 2 - Web Scraping + Downloading + Pandas

The [second exercise](data-engineering-practice/exercise-2) tests your ability perform web scraping, build uris, download files, and use Pandas to do some simple cumulative actions.
